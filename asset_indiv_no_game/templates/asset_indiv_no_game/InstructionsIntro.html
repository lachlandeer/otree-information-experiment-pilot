    <h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>In this task, you will engage in {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decision-making problems. In each decision problem, you will weigh up all information to guess the Target Value of a hypothetical asset:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Target Value = the Value of the Asset (V)</p>
    <p>Your Target Value depends on the value of the asset (V). <b>The value of the asset (V) is randomly determined and may vary for each decision problem</b>.</p>
    <p>You can maximize your potential payoff in each decision problem by correctly estimating the value of the asset.</p>
