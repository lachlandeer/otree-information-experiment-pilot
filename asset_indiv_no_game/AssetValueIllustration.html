            <p>In each decision problem, a hypothetical asset with a value, V, ranging from 50 to 150, will be randomly selected by the computer.</p>
            <p>As shown in the figure, the height of each bar shows the chance of different values being selected. 100 is the average of all potential values, and it has the highest chance of being selected as V.  Values closer to this <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mean Value</span>, 100, are more likely to be selected as V than those further away from 100.</p>
            <p>You will not observe V, the value of the selected asset directly, but you will see four pieces of information about V. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mean Value</span>, 100, is always one of them.</p>
