            <p>After V is selected, three pieces of information about V, that will be referred to as signals, ranging from V-50 to V+50, will be randomly selected by the computer.</p>
            <p>Again, the height of each bar shows the chance of each number being selected as a signal. The shape is exactly the same as the one in the Asset Value figure you have seen in the last screen. The selected value V is the average of all potential signals, and it has the highest chance of being selected as a signal.</p>
            <p>Values closer to V are more likely to be selected as a signal than those further away from V.</p>
